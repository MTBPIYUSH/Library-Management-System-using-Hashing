# Library Management System using Hashing

The Library Management System is a software solution built in C that utilizes hashing, a data structure, for
efficient book storage and retrieval. It employs a hash table with an additive hash function to map book titles
to unique indices. Linear probing is used to handle collisions. The system offers functionalities like adding,
borrowing, returning, and deleting books, as well as displaying available and borrowed book lists. It has a
user-friendly menu interface and robust error handling. The modular design and well-documented code allow
for maintainability and future enhancements. By leveraging hashing, the system streamlines library
operations, reduces manual effort, and enhances the user experience while demonstrating the practical
application of computer science concepts
