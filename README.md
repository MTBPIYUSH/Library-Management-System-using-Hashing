# Library Management System using Hashing

1. The Library Management System is a software solution built in C that utilizes hashing, a data structure, for efficient book storage and retrieval.
2. It employs a hash table with an additive hash function to map book titles to unique indices.
3. Linear probing is used to handle collisions.
4. The system offers functionalities like adding, borrowing, returning, and deleting books, as well as displaying available and borrowed book lists.
5. It has a user-friendly menu interface and robust error handling.
6. The modular design and well-documented code allow for maintainability and future enhancements.
7. By leveraging hashing, the system streamlines library operations, reduces manual effort, and enhances the user experience while demonstrating the practical application of computer science concepts
