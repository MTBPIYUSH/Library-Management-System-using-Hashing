            <h3>Cab Booking System using Python</h3>
            <p>The goal was to design a functional and responsive system using Python language. Further modified it into one program from the customer's perspective and one from the company's perspective. It utilized developing specific functions for the tasks making it convenient for the programmer to maintain the code for future references and further modifications and integration.<br>Worked on this project during the 2nd year of my intermediate <a href="http://www.bnsbhilai.com/index.aspx">@Bhilai Nair Samajam</a>. Used Python as front-end to design the main menu interface and .csv files as backend to store the respective data.<br>The following link leads to the repository containing the said project files:</p>

            <h3>Bus Ticketing System using C</h3>
            <p>The Bus Ticketing System is a software solution made for the convenience of the driver. It includes options such as loggin in with <i>ID</i> and <i>password</i>, helps the driver to check its availability and make respective reservations at specific bus stops. The program can be further modified and with more added functionalities and a validated approach, it may can also be converted into a product.</p>

            <h3>Library Management System using Hashing</h3>
            <p>The Library Management System is a software solution built in C that utilizes hashing, a data structure, for efficient book storage and retrieval. It employs a hash table with an additive hash function to map book titles to unique indices. Linear probing is used to handle collisions. The system offers functionalities like adding, borrowing, returning, and deleting books, as well as displaying available and borrowed book lists. It has a user-friendly menu interface and robust error handling. The modular design and well-documented code allow for maintainability and future enhancements. By leveraging hashing, the system streamlines library operations, reduces manual effort, and enhances the user experience while demonstrating the practical application of computer science concepts.</p>
